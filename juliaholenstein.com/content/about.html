            <p>
            I understand creative teams,&nbsp;and bring out the best in them. Delivering results with maximum productivity through inspiration, motivation, innovation and coordination.
            I use a collaborative&nbsp;outcomes focused approach to develop and build cultures of excellence, craftsmanship and continual improvement. I enjoy empowering a team's capacity 
            to produce more compelling work, tackle greater workloads, and&nbsp;employ design thinking principles to solve problems. Finally, I believe in maximizing success with razor-sharp, objectives-based focus on delivering seamless brand experience across all customer touchpoints.&#8232;
            <p>
            Besides my creative ability, I am passionate about social issues and believe I believe in using my design abilities to deliver purpose-driven content. I volunteer regularly at the Alameda Food Bank and run social media sites for young artists and athletes. At JanSport, I had the opportunity to work with several of our non-profit partners, and I found this work very rewarding. I worked with 
            Big City Mountaineers, a non-profit that provides wilderness trips for at-risk youth, and their affiliate, 
            Summit for Someone. I also did some work for other affiliates including, 
            Leave No Trace for Outdoor Ethics, which involves educating people of all ages about the ethics of outdoors, 
            Philmont Scout Ranch, and Telluride Film Festival, benefitting the Telluride Arts District. In my spare time I even do some social media marketing for outdoor youth sports and youth art clubs. I believe strongly in diversity and inclusion and strive to bring issues of inequality to light.
